# Aha! Funnel Report

This is a small Rails application that creates a funnel report of ideas from your Aha! account. 

The app is intended to address idea [APP-I-3533](https://big.ideas.aha.io/ideas/APP-I-3533) from the Aha! website.

Oauth2 is used to allow the app to access data within an Aha! account via the Aha! API.

For privacy, no Aha! user data is ever persisted.
